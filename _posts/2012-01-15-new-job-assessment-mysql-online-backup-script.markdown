These is one of the proposed solutions for the job assessment [commented in a previous post](http://keymon.wordpress.com/2012/01/15/some-posts-froâ€¦job-assessment).


> _How could you backup all the data of a MySQL installation without taking the DB down at all. The DB is 100G and is write intensive. Provide script.
_


My solution to this problem will be _"Online backup using LVM snapshots in a replication slave"_.
It implies that a series of previous decisions have been taken:



	
  * 


**LVM snapshots**: Database data files must be on a [LVM](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logical_Volume_Manager_%28Linux%29) volume, which will allow the creation of [snapshots](http://www.linux.org/docs/ldp/howto/LVM-HOWTO/snapshots_backup.html). An alternative could be use [Btrfs snapshots](https://btrfs.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/Main_Page).


Advantages:

	
    * Almost online backup: The DB will continue working while copying the data files.

	
    * Simple to setup and without cost.

	
    * You can even start a separated mysql instance (with RW snapshots in LVM2) to perform any task.


Drawbacks:

	
    * To ensure the data file integrity the tables must be locked while creating the snapshot.
The snapshot creation is fast (~2s), but this means a lock anyway.

	
    * All datafiles must be in the same Logical Volume, to ensure an atomic snapshot.

	
    * The snapshot has an overhead that will decrease the write/read performance
([it is said](http://www.mysqlperformanceblog.com/2009/02/05/disaster-lvm-performance-in-snapshot-mode/)
that up to a 6x overhead). This is because any Logical Extend modified must be copied. After a while this overhead will be reduced because changes are usually made in the same Logical Extends.




	
  * 


**Replication slaves**: (see official documentation about[ replication backups](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/replication-solutions-backups.html) and [backup raw data in slaves](http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.1/en/replication-solutions-backups-rawdata.html) ).
Backup operations will be executed in a slave instead of in the master.


Advantages:

	
    * Will avoid the performance impact in the Master mysql server,
since _"the slave can be paused and shut down without affecting the running operation of the master"_.

	
    * Any backup technique can be done. In fact, using this second method should be enough.

	
    * Simple to setup.

	
    * If there is already a MySQL cluster it will use existent infrastructure.


Drawbacks:

	
    * This is more an architectonic solution or backup policy than a backupscript.

	
    * If there are logical inconsistencies in the slave, they are included in the backup.





So, I will suppose that:

	
  * MySQL data files are stored in a LVM logical volume, with enough free
LEs in the volume group to create snapshots.

	
  * The backupscript will be executed in a working replication slave, not in the master.
Execution of this script on a master will result in a short service pause (tables locked)
and I/O performance impact.


This is the backup script (tested with xfs) that must be executed on a Slave replication server:
