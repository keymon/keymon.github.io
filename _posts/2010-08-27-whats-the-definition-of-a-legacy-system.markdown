Today I found this funny quote in http://www.texas400.com/

I created an stupid poster for it :)


[![What's the definition of a legacy system ? One that works! ](http://keymon.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/legacy-system-definition.jpg)](http://keymon.files.wordpress.com/2010/08/legacy-system-definition.jpg)


Updated: Of cuorse, I do not mean that "Legacy systems are better". I see in this quote a ironic fact: you spend time and efford on a system and when it finally works properly... it is legacy and should be replaced :)
